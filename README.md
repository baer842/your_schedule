# EigenPlan for Untis

EigenPlan is a third-party mobile client for the Untis timetable.

## Features

EigenPlan reads the timetable from the Untis API and displays it to you - customizable.

- Filter by class - No need to look endlessly for your classes, as only your classes are displayed.
- Change color of classes - Capture everything with a quick glance - Due to customizable colors.

## Documentation

I documented the whole process in my high school research paper, which you can find on
my [website](https://untis-connect.laslo-hauschild.eu/Facharbeit.pdf).
Note that this document is in German. Basically, I reverse-engineered the Untis API with HTTP-Toolkit and wrote a
Flutter app to display the data.

## Testing

If your school uses Untis and doesn't provide individual credentials, I'd be glad to support you to get the app running
for you school as well!
It should, in theory, already work, but you never know. If you need credentials to test the app yourself, please contact
me.

Pull requests and issues are always welcome.

## Verification

Before opening a PR, this project expects:

1. **Static analysis** — `flutter analyze` must pass cleanly.
2. **Code generation** — `dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs` must succeed.
3. **Build** — `flutter build apk --debug --target-platform android-arm64` must succeed. (Release
   builds need a local `key.properties` this repo doesn't ship with, so verification always targets
   debug.)
4. **Tests**, in two tiers:
   - `flutter test` — offline unit tests against fixtures derived from `docs/api/captures/`, no
     network or credentials needed.
   - `flutter test --tags=live --run-skipped` — exercises the real Untis API with real school
     credentials to check everything still parses. **Never run in CI.** See
     [`test/live/README.md`](test/live/README.md) for how to provide credentials.

Tiers 1–3 and the offline test tier run in CI on every PR
([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)). Locally, the Claude Code `Stop` hook
([`.claude/hooks/verify-before-stop.sh`](.claude/hooks/verify-before-stop.sh)) runs all of the
above, including the live-API tier, at its default `full` verification level — see `CLAUDE.md`.

### Code generation

Generate the necessary code:
```shell
dart run build_runner build
```

### Release builds

Release APKs (the ones published to GitHub Releases and mirrored by IzzyOnDroid) are built
with [`tool/build_release_apk.sh`](tool/build_release_apk.sh). The script refuses to build
unless the Flutter SDK matches what `pubspec.yaml` declares, because the Flutter version,
channel and remote URL are compiled into the APK and a mismatch silently breaks reproducible
builds.

EigenPlan aims to be reproducible; [`docs/reproducible-builds.md`](docs/reproducible-builds.md)
documents the exact build environment a rebuilder has to match and explains why each part of it
matters. [`tool/rb_compare.sh`](tool/rb_compare.sh) builds the APK twice and reports which zip
entries differ, so reproducibility can be checked locally instead of via a release:

```shell
tool/rb_compare.sh                            # two builds, identical environment
tool/rb_compare.sh --second 'taskset -c 0-3'  # vary one thing: the CPU count
```
