# Toolchain check.
#
# Since Flutter 3.32 every build bakes FLUTTER_VERSION / FLUTTER_CHANNEL /
# FLUTTER_GIT_URL (and three more) into the AOT snapshot as compile-time
# constants - see FlutterVersion in packages/flutter/lib/src/services/
# flutter_version.dart. They cannot be overridden (flutter_tools exits if you
# try), and their values come straight from the SDK's git checkout: the channel
# is the local branch name (detached HEAD => "[user-branch]"), the git URL is
# the clone URL verbatim. A differently-shaped SDK checkout therefore silently
# changes the shipped bytes and breaks reproducible builds, which is why this
# refuses to build rather than warn. See docs/reproducible-builds.md.

The release build was aborted because the toolchain does not match what this
release declares. To put the SDK at "$flutter_root" into the expected state:

  git -C "$flutter_root" remote set-url origin https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
  git -C "$flutter_root" fetch --tags origin
  git -C "$flutter_root" checkout -B stable "$expected_flutter"

Use 'checkout -B stable', never a detached 'checkout $expected_flutter': the
branch name is what ends up in the APK as FLUTTER_CHANNEL.
